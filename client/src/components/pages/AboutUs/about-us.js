//                 Roomeo has users do quick background checks and gives the option to link social media accounts so both 
//                 roommates can feel more confident and secure in the process. Once you're ready to message a potential â€œRoome," 
//                 you can do so through the app so you don't have to exchange any personal contact information until you're ready.
//                 You can look for someone to move into your open space, move into a vacant room 
//                 someone else is offering or find a new roommate to look for an entirely new apartment with.
//                 Members can match based on testimonials from friends, hobbies, interests and questions answered through their 
//                 profiles. Roomster allows users to link their social accounts, so this app tends to have more 
//                 data to find the perfect match. Once you find a potential roommate that looks promising, 
//                 you can connect with them through the Roomster mailbox.
